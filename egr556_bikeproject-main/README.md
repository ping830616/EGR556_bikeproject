# EGR556_BikeProject 


• Implemented a sliding mode controller (SMC) to stabilize an autonomous bike for vehicle safety. 


• Estimated the maximum value of the initial roll angle to achieve stability as 0.63 degrees.


• Performed MATLAB simulations to observe that the FSF controller stabilizes the bicycle with 50s.
